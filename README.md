# Navigate your .json file easily!

With the help of *json_navigator.py* you can browse through your file in details.

In directory *json_files* you can see examples of .json files, returned with the help of TwitterAPI.

## Interaction

To navigate your .json file open *json_navigator.py* and just start it.
You'll need to type in correct path to your .json file and enjoy browsing!

Before starting, make sure that you have all required packages downloaded:
* json 
* pandas
* fonttools (do not need for *json_navigator.py*)

## Specific data

There is also included file *specific_data.py*. It's just additional file, that is usable ONLY for *cats.json*.

You can give it a try, but if you want to easily navigate your .json, just use *json_navigator.py*.

## Full dataset

In the beginning and in the end of programme, you have a chance to look at full dataset.
